# Quicksort-1---Partition
The previous challenges covered Insertion Sort, which is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm with a running time of n. In these next few challenges, we're covering a divide-and-conquer algorithm called Quicksort (also known as Partition Sort). This challenge is a modified version of the algorithm that only addresses partitioning. It is implemented as follows:

Function Description

Complete the quickSort function in the editor below. It should return an array of integers as described above.

quickSort has the following parameter(s):

arr: an array of integers where arr[0] is the pivot element 

Sample Input

5
4 5 3 7 2
