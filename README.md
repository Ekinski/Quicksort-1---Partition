# Quicksort-1---Partition
The previous challenges covered Insertion Sort, which is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm with a running time of n. In these next few challenges, we're covering a divide-and-conquer algorithm called Quicksort (also known as Partition Sort). This challenge is a modified version of the algorithm that only addresses partitioning. It is implemented as follows:
